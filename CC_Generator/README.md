# CC Generator
This genertor was made for the SDET Cyclomatic Complexity project.

## Description
This version of a code generator was specifically made to create files and functions with a known cyclomatic complexity as an oracle to then use in testing for tooling to determine cyclomatic complexity

## Output
### Languages
C
### Code Complexity
Simple
### Control
Coarse
### Feature Coverage
Minimal

## Usage Instructions
Run from "CC_runner.py"

The generator is entirely data driven from "config.csv".

...Insert details on format for config.csv...

## Installation
Clone the project locally and run "CC_runner.py"

## Use Case
To generate a volume of C code with a known cyclomatic complexity. This generator is not intended to be used to generate sophisticated or novel code.
